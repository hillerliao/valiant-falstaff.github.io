# Notes

# 1

# Automatically create an html id for each h1, h2, h3, ... tag. Let's say
# your markdown file heading is
#
# ##Increasing Algorithm Speed
#
# then instead of the HTML output just being
# 
# <h2>Increasing Algorithm Speed</h2>
# 
# It will be
#
# <h2 id="increasing-algorithm-speed">Increasing Algorithm Speed</h2>
#
# This will allow us to re-create on our own site that helpful heading
# same-page link feature you see on github .md files (called deep anchor
# links), where when you hover over an h1, h2, etc tag, a little "link" icon
# appears to the left of the heading, and clicking on the heading updates the
# URL bar to the same-page link at that heading, making it easier for visitors
# to link to important parts of the blog.
